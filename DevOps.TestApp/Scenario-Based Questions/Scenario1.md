# Scenario: Multi-Environment Deployment


1. **Create Separate Pipelines for Each Environment**: I would set up a single release pipeline that handles all environments, but with stages for **development**, **staging**, and **production**. Each stage would have its own approvals and checks to enusre smooth transitions between environments.

2. **Use Environment-Specific Configurations**: For handling different configurations in each environment (like database connections or API keys), i would use **Azure DevOps variable groups**. These allow me to define environment-specific variables and link them to the appropriate pipeline stages.

3. **Manage Secrets with Azure Key Vault**: Sensitive information, like passwords or connection strings, would be stored securely in **Azure Key Vault**. The pipeline would access these secrets at runtime, ensuring sensitive data is never hardcoded or exposed in the code.

4. **Automate Rollbacks**: I would configure the pipeline to support **automatic rollbacks** in case a deployment to an environment fails. This can be done by setting conditions where, if certain tests or checks fail, the previous stable version of the application is redeployed automatically.

5. **Implement Approvals and Gates**: For higher environments like staging and production, i would set up **manual approvals** and **gates**. This means a human reviewer or automated checks (like performance or security scans) would need to approve before deployment can proceed.

6. **Test in Staging Before Production**: The staging environment would be an exact replica of production, allowing for thorough testing. All deployments would go through development and staging before reaching production to catch any issues early.
